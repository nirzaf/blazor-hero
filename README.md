# Getting Started 🦸

> **Important**
If you are already using Blazor Hero v1.x, make sure that you drop your existing database and re-update your database using the CLI as there are a couple of new migrations added that might clash with your existing schema. Also, install the latest version of BlazorHero.

The easiest way to get started with Blazor Hero is to install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BlazorHero.CleanArchitecture/) and run `dotnet new BlazorHero.CleanArchitecture`:

1. Install the latest [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
2. Install the latest DOTNET & EF CLI Tools by using this command `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` 
3. Install the latest version of Visual Studio IDE 2019 (v16.8 and above) 🚀
4. Open up Command Prompt and run `dotnet new --install BlazorHero.CleanArchitecture` to install the project template
5. Create a folder for your solution and cd into it (the template will use it as project name)
6. Run `dotnet new BlazorHero.CleanArchitecture` to create a new Solution with all the Awesomeness 🕶️ of BlazorHero 🦸

## Getting Started with Docker in Windows :rocket:

- Install Docker on Windows via `https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/`
- Open up Powershell on Windows and run the following
    - `cd c:\`
    - `dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p securePassword123`
    - `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
    - Note - Make sure that you use the same password that has been configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file. By default, `securePassword123` is configured.
- 5005 & 5006 are the ports setup to run blazorHero on Docker, so make sure that these ports are free. You could also change the ports in the `docker-compose.yml` and `Server\Dockerfile` files.
- Now navigate back to the root of the BlazorHero Project on your local machine and run the following via terminal - `docker-compose -f 'docker-compose.yml' up --build`
- This will start pulling MSSQL Server Image from Docker Hub if you don't already have this image. It's around 500+ Mbs of download.
- Once that is done, dotnet SDKs and runtimes are downloaded, if not present already. That's almost 200+ more Mbs of download.
- PS If you find any issues while Docker installs the nuget packages, it is most likely that your ssl certificates are not installed properly. Apart from that I also added the `--disable-parallel` in the `Server\Dockerfile`to ensure network issues don't pop-up. You can remove this option to speed up the build process.
- That's almost everything. Once the containers are available, migrations are updated in the MSSQL DB, default data is seeded.
- Browse to https://localhost:5005/ to use your version of BlazorHero !

3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Here are the few contributions that I would highly appreciate ;)

- [ ] Need someone to add in the API Documentation for Swagger.
- [ ] Need someone to implement localization throughout every Razor Component of the solution under the WASM(Client) Project. You can take the Pages/Authentication/Login.razor as the point of reference. It is as simple as adding `@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.IStringLocalizer<Login> localizer` to every page, changing the texts to `@localizer["Text Here"]` and finally adding resx files to the Resources Folder as per the folder structure.
- [ ] Need few contributors to add in various language translations as per the implemented Location. I got time to only add a few translations for French as of now.
- [ ] Need a UI contributor to look at the UX/UI of the entire project
- [ ] Need someone to buildup a cool Material Logo for BlazorHero (BH):D Do contact me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/iammukeshm/).
- [ ] And finally, Stars from everyone! :D
